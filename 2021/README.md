Advent of Code 2021
===

This year, I'm doing Advent of Code in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). Each day is a separate binary crate, so e.g. day 1 can be built and executed like so:

```sh
cargo +nightly run --bin day_1
```

*Note: Nightly Rust is required! Install it with `rustup install nightly`*
